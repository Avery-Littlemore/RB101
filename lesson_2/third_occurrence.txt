# Pseudo-Code to build a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character 
# in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method 
# should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil

START

GET string from user
SET user_str = string from user

GET character from user
SET user_char = character from user

SET iterator = 0
SET occurence = 0
SET index == nil

WHILE iterator < length of user_str
  READ character in the iterator position of the user_str
  check if the character is equal to our user_char
  IF user_char == character in iterator position 
    occurrence = occurrence + 1
    IF occurrence == 3
      index = iterator


IF occurrence >= 3
  PRINT index
